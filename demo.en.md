# Computer vision models: seed classification project 

## By AI Lab, Canadian Food Inspection Agency 



## Introduction




The AI Lab team at the Canadian Food Inspection Agency CFIA) is composed of a diverse group of experts, including data scientists, software developers, and graduate researchers, all working together to provide innovative solutions for the advancement of Canadian society. By collaborating with members from inter-departmental branches of government, the AI Lab leverages state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms to provide data-driven solutions to real-world problems and drive positive change.

At the CFIA's AI Lab, we harness the full potential of deep learning models. Our dedicated team of Data Scientists leverage the power of this transformative technology and develop customised solutions tailored to meet the specific needs of our clients.

In this article, we motivate the need for computer vision models for the automatic classification of seed species. We demonstrate how our custom models have achieved promising results using "real-world" seed images and describe our future directions for deploying a user-friendly SeedID application.

At the CFIA AI Lab, we strive not only to push the frontiers of science by leveraging cutting-edge models but also in rendering these services accessible to others and foster knowledge sharing, for the continuous advancement of our Canadian society.
